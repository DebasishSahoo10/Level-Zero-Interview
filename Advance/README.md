1. Create a web app, where I input my name, and then I input a password. If the password contains the input name in it, show an error message "Password can't have name"
2. Create a web app, which On the Click of a button fetches data from the provided API and from the data, displays the item with the highest price on the screen, below the button. API : https://mock-practice.prakhar10v.repl.co/items
3. Create 2 buttons with text YJHD and ZNMD. At the click of a button, call the given API with the query as same as the button text, and display the message you get on the screen. Followup: Instead of using calling the fetch function twice in both events(clicking of buttons), enclose it in a different function so that it can be used accordingly in both areas.

In the response, you will get an OTP which should be shown on the screen. Make another input section that asks the user to guess the OTP and for checking whether the guess is equal to the actual one or not add a button "Validate" which on clicking shows the message "Success " or "Failure" depending. Change the color of validating message to GREEN when success comes up and change it to RED if failure comes up on the click of Validate Button.
